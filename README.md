# EliteBooker
> EliteBooker is the most ordinary bookshop, where the customer creates an account, then gets access to see the available books. He can, of course, place an order, having first added it to his basket. Then, in the order tab, he can follow the progress of the order. The management of available books, users and orders is done by an employee who has admin rights.
